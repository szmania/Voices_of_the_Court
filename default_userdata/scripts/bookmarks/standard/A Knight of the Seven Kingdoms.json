    "content": "The Osgrey family, a noble house from the Reach, is involved in events during the early reign of King Aerys I Targaryen. In 211 AC, as depicted in 'The Sworn Sword,' they form an alliance with House Webber to address local disputes and threats. This alliance strengthens their position in the region, but their influence remains limited compared to greater houses. The Osgreys are known for their loyalty and traditional values, often clashing with more ambitious neighbors. Their story highlights the minor power struggles in the Reach during a period of relative peace in the Seven Kingdoms, though specific details of their activities on this date are not fully documented in the provided timeline."

    "content": "Eustace Osgrey, a loyal supporter of Daemon I Blackfyre, participated in the First Blackfyre Rebellion. He joined the rebellion with the hope of reclaiming his family's lost castle, Coldmoat, which had been promised to him by Daemon. During the Battle of the Redgrass Field, Eustace fought valiantly but suffered devastating personal losses: his three sons, Ser Edwyn, Ser Harrold, and the squire Addam Osgrey, were all killed in the conflict. Following the battle, his only daughter, Alysanne, was taken as a hostage to King's Landing, where she later perished during the Great Spring Sickness. This series of tragedies further weakened House Osgrey, which had already declined from its former prominence as a powerful noble house to a mere landed knightly family holding only Standfast tower, marking a somber chapter in their history amidst the civil war's chaos."

Born in the tenth year of the last Targaryen king's reign, he was discovered by an acolyte and taken in by Archmaester Edgerran, who initially saw him as a subject for infant swaddling studies. Raised among servants, Yandel learned letters from Archmaester Walgrave, fostering a deep love for knowledge. He forged his first chain link at age thirteen and completed his maester's chain in the ninth year of King Robert's reign. Inspired by the works of predecessors, Yandel dedicates himself to compiling a comprehensive history, aiming to educate humble folk about the world's diverse events, peoples, and lands, drawing from the vast archives of the Citadel to create an accessible and enlightening tome."

Maester Kennet, in his work 'Passages of the Dead' from the reign of Cregan Stark, studied barrow fields in the North, uncovering evidence of giant burials. Giants were primitive, reaching up to 14 feet tall, covered in fur, and used basic tools like tree branches. They lived in caverns or under trees, with no kings or metalworking. The children of the forest, in contrast, were skilled with obsidian tools, weirwood bows, and lived in tree shelters. They worshipped nature gods and carved faces into weirwoods, possibly for spiritual purposes. Legends suggest greenseers had mystical abilities, such as communicating with animals, leading to skinchanger myths. The era was marked by tribal conflicts, including disputes between children and giants over territories like caverns, as hinted in wildling songs. This primitive age set the foundation for later civilizations in Westeros."

Redwyn's journey to Lorn Point and the Frozen Shore involved encounters with giants and trade with the children of the forest. Aemon found such records credible in the Night's Watch archives. Giants were solitary, living in natural shelters without societal structures, while the children used obsidian for hunting and lived in harmony with forests. Their speech was melodic, inspired by natural sounds, and they practiced arts like carving weirwoods. Conflicts arose, such as disputes over caverns mediated by figures like Gendel and Gorne, though wildling tales are unreliable. The children's greenseers were believed to have abilities like distant vision, but much remains shrouded in myth.

This ability degraded over time, with modern maesters only understanding basic raven behaviors. Barth's theories, based on texts from Castle Black, sparked debate at the Citadel, but no proof exists. The children, led by greenseers, lived in forests, bogs, and tree towns, using obsidian tools and weirwood bows. They worshipped nameless nature gods and carved weirwood faces, possibly for surveillance. Legends of skinchangers and wargs emerged from their alleged animal communication. Giants coexisted uneasily, with evidence of conflicts, such as obsidian arrowheads in giant burials. The Dawn Age was a time of mystical arts and tribal life, preceding recorded history in Westeros."

They brought with them bronze weapons, horses, cattle, and new gods, leading to conflict with the indigenous children of the forest. The children, defending their sacred weirwood trees from being cut down, engaged in centuries of warfare using wood dancers and greenseers who summoned beasts like direwolves and mammoths. Despite their efforts, the children were unable to halt the First Men's advance. Legends suggest the greenseers caused great floods to break the land bridge and swamp the Neck, though this is likely exaggerated. Eventually, both sides, weary of war, forged the Pact on the Isle of Faces in the Gods Eye, ending the Dawn Age. The children retained deep forests, and the First Men vowed to protect the weirwoods, establishing the green men to guard the island."

Valyrian steel, known for its strength and magical properties, was produced through advanced smithing techniques now largely lost. The Braavosi, unique among the Free Cities, were founded by escaped slaves who revolted and established a hidden city based on freedom and religious tolerance.

Garin assembled a massive army of 250,000 men at Chroyane, divided into three groups to march down the Rhoyne River, supported by a fleet of war galleys. They destroyed Valyrian outposts, won battles at Selhorys and Valysar, and defeated a force at Volon Therys that included dragonlords, with Rhoynish water wizards and archers bringing down dragons. However, Valyria responded with an overwhelming force of hundreds of dragons, leading to the decimation of Garin's army.

After finishing the story, the king grew tired and sent the children away, then fell into a sleep from which he never awoke. His death ended a reign of twenty-six years that had overseen the most prosperous era in Seven Kingdoms history, yet it also seeded the disastrous decline of House Targaryen and the eventual death of the last dragons. This event directly triggered the Dance of the Dragons, as the succession dispute between his daughter Rhaenyra and son Aegon II erupted into civil war shortly after his passing."

Aerys attended, revealing his deteriorated state, and knighted Jaime Lannister into the Kingsguard before sending him away. During the tourney, the mysterious Knight of the Laughing Tree appeared, angering Aerys, who suspected Jaime. Rhaegar won the competition and crowned Lyanna Stark as queen of love and beauty, insulting his wife Elia Martell and sparking outrage from Lyanna's betrothed, Robert Baratheon, and her brothers. This act, along with Rhaegar's later abduction of Lyanna, set the stage for Robert's Rebellion, leading to widespread conflict and the downfall of the Targaryen dynasty."

    "content": "Archmaester Walgram compiles his seminal work, 'The Reckoning of Time,' addressing the complex issue of how different cultures across the known world measure days, seasons, and years. This scholarly endeavor highlights the challenges in reconciling historical dates from various civilizations, such as the Free Cities, Valyria, and Old Ghis, with the unified timeline of Westeros. Walgram's work becomes a foundational text for maesters at the Citadel, providing insights into the diverse calendrical systems used in Essos and beyond. Despite its importance, the treatise acknowledges the limitations of existing knowledge, particularly regarding distant lands like Sothoryos and Ulthos, and emphasizes that much of the information derives from travelers' tales and legends rather than verified records."

    "content": "Aegon I Targaryen, with his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, launched an invasion of the Iron Islands to solidify his conquest of Westeros. Using their dragons, the Targaryens swiftly subdued the ironborn, who had long resisted external rule. Vickon Greyjoy of Pyke was appointed Lord of the Iron Islands, swearing fealty to the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, Queen Visenya dealt with an uprising in the Three Sisters, employing dragonfire to crush the rebellion and enforce Targaryen authority. These actions extended Aegon's dominion, bringing the Iron Islands under his control and demonstrating the overwhelming power of the dragons in quelling dissent across the realm."

    "content": "Lomas Longstrider, the famed explorer, visited the Summer Isles in his quest for wonders. He documented the archipelago's lush landscapes, teeming with exotic flora and fauna, and recorded the claims of local sages about their ancestors' ancient settlements on Sothoryos, which were allegedly destroyed by the same forces that later overwhelmed Ghiscari and Valyrian colonies. The Summer Islanders, isolated for much of their history, had only recently begun exploring beyond their shores after initial contact with the Ghiscari, who mistakenly feared them as demons. Under Prince Malthar the Windrider, they built larger ships, launching an era of exploration and trade, particularly with Valyria, exchanging gemstones, spices, hardwoods, and wildlife for gold and other goods. However, this period also saw the rise of slaving raids, leading to centuries of conflict known as the Years of Shame, until Princess Xanda Qo united the islands and developed swan ships and goldenheart bows to combat the slavers, ultimately prevailing in the Slavers' Wars."

    "content": "This chapter explores the geography and history of the lands east of Vaes Dothrak, focusing on the formidable Bones mountain range, which stretches over five hundred leagues and is littered with the bones of ancient travelers and creatures like the Jhogwin stone giants. It details the three main passes—the Steel, Stone, and Sand Roads—guarded by fortress cities such as Kayakayanaya, Samyriana, and Bayasabhad, ruled by warrior women. The narrative extends to the Golden Empire of Yi Ti, describing its legendary wealth, turbulent history with god-emperors like Lo Bu and Jar Har, and conflicts with the Jogos Nhai nomads, led by figures like Zhea, who defeated Lo Bu in a brutal war. The chapter also covers the island of Leng, its tall native people, and the mysterious Asshai-by-the-Shadow, a sorcery-steeped city with no children and a polluted river, hinting at deeper enigmas in the Further East."

    "content": "Archmaester Gyldayn reflects on the tumultuous changes in Westeros since he began writing this history during the peaceful early years of King Robert Baratheon's reign. Initially intended as a dedication to Robert and his heirs, the work was disrupted by the chaos following the death of Hand Jon Arryn, which led to Robert's demise and the rise of pretenders like Joffrey Baratheon. Amidst rumors of dragons reborn in the east and ongoing conflicts for the Iron Throne, Gyldayn expresses hope for King Tommen's just and long reign to restore stability. The afterword acknowledges the collaborative efforts of various artists and contributors in illustrating the lineages and key locations, emphasizing the historical significance of events like the Battle of the Trident and the enduring legacy of houses such as Targaryen, Stark, and Lannister in these troubled times."
